        <p>(UPDATED) THE seven-day Covid-19 positivity rate in the National Capital Region (NCR) or Metro Manila rose by 1.2 percent increase â€” from 12.1 percent on September 2 to 13.3 percent on September 9, OCTA Research reported Sunday.
            This increase was gleaned after an average of 10,247 daily RT-PCR tests were made over the past week.
            The World Health Organization (WHO) sets a 5-percent positivity benchmark for declaring that Covid in a particular area is under control.
            
            OCTA also noted that the reproduction number, referring to the number of new cases caused by one infected individual, also rose from 0.93 on August 31 to 1.11 on September 7.
            "The reproduction number has increased to greater than 1, which means [Covid-19] infections are increasing," OCTA Research fellow Dr. Guido David said in a tweet on Sunday.

        <p> Mike Trout homered in his sixth straight game to set an Angels franchise record, Shohei Ohtani threw five solid innings before exiting because of a blister and Los Angeles beat the Houston Astros 6-1 on Saturday (Sunday in Manila).
            Trout hit his 34th homer, a three-run drive to left field in the second inning. The three-time AL MVP broke the club mark of five games in a row with a homer set by Bobby Bonds in 1977.
            "It's pretty cool," Trout said of the achievement. "I've just been preparing myself, trying to get my swing right and not missing pitches. I got some pitches to hit tonight and put a good swing on them." 
            Ken Griffey Jr., Don Mattingly and Dale Long share the major league record of eight games in a row with a home run. Ohtani (12-8) yielded one run on six hits with seven strikeouts until leaving with a blister on his right index finger. He threw the fastest pitch of his career at 101.4 mph in the third inning, according to Statcast.
            "I had a little rough first inning, things weren't going our way, but I was able to fight through that," Ohtani said through a translator. "Once we got through that inning, momentum was on our side."
            Ohtani said he felt fine and thought he got out of the game before it became more severe.
            The right-hander has allowed three runs or fewer in eight straight starts.</p>
